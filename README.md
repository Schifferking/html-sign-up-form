# html-sign-up-form

This project mainly uses the form elements from HTML along with others concepts learned on the previous lessons to make a fake website that lets a user enter data required to create an account of said website. The objective is to acquire practice with those concepts. As an optional feature, it's suggested to implement javascript to validate the password fields contain the same password and then properly style those fields. In the future, I'll revisit this project and implement this feature.
